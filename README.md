## Introduction

Welcome to CS667 - Practical Data Science! This project-based course is designed to guide you through the full lifecycle of a data science project, from ideation to implementation. You will explore how to formulate impactful questions, acquire and prepare data, build and validate models, and develop deployable solutions. Our aim is to foster the mindset and technical fluency required to thrive in today’s data-driven world.

## Projects

You will engage in multiple project experiences throughout this course. These include core class projects and optional opportunities to collaborate with external partners on real-world applications.

The primary goal of these projects is to immerse you in the end-to-end workflow of practical data science. You will learn to scope problems, select appropriate tools, build reliable pipelines, and create solutions that can operate in real environments. Projects will be discussed during class and can be adjusted based on your interests and backgrounds.

These opportunities are valuable for developing portfolios that reflect your capability to solve industry-relevant problems. While collaboration and guidance are available, a strong sense of ownership and initiative is encouraged.

## AI-First and GenAI Projects

In today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape, AI-first and Generative AI-first (GenAI-first) design approaches are becoming increasingly vital. An AI-first approach prioritizes artificial intelligence from the outset—integrating intelligent decision-making and automation deeply into the solution architecture. GenAI-first expands this to include models that can generate text, code, images, and more, transforming how systems are designed and how users interact with them.

This course encourages the development of AI-first and GenAI-first projects. Whether you're creating personalized learning platforms, intelligent document processors, or virtual assistants, consider how machine learning and generative models can be embedded natively into the solution. Projects that demonstrate creativity, responsible innovation, and a focus on user-centric AI design will be especially encouraged.

## Guidance

Throughout the course, you will be exposed to both technical and strategic elements of practical data science. Below are some general recommendations for a successful journey:

- Approach each project with an engineering mindset: plan your architecture, version your data, and monitor your outputs.
- Prioritize clarity in communication—your deliverables should tell a story and be accessible to a broad audience.
- Embrace iteration. The path from data to insight to impact often requires trial and error.
- Make ethical considerations part of your workflow, especially when handling sensitive data or building models with real-world influence.
- When possible, aim to build solutions that are **deployable**, **scalable**, and **intelligent by design**.
- Stay updated with recent developments in AI and machine learning, especially in areas such as large language models, multimodal learning, and responsible AI.
