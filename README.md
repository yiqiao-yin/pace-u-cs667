## Introduction

Welcome to CS667 - Practical Data Science! This project-based course is designed to guide you through the full lifecycle of a data science project, from ideation to production. You will learn how to formulate a problem, collect and preprocess data, build and validate models, and deploy your solutions into real-world environments. By the end of the course, you will have practical experience in handling data science challenges and delivering deployable solutions.

## Grading

This course is graded on a Pass/Fail basis. To pass, you must successfully complete a complete data science, machine learning, or AI project, demonstrating your understanding of the data science lifecycle and your ability to produce functional, real-world-ready solutions.

We will be using [this link](https://airtable.com/embed/appBjNPgdot15ZqO7/pagKL7hfbTouEflS9/form) for all of the submissions.

You will pass this class if both of the following criteria have been met:
- Fill up the submission form after every single class as participation. You can be excused for 2 classes for medical reasons.
- Upon approval of the completion of the project.

## Projects

Each student must complete three projects during the course: two smaller projects and one final project. You can choose from the provided options or propose your own idea, subject to instructor approval.

### Option 1: Agent-based Search Engine

Build a functional agent-based search engine that can handle user queries dynamically. This project will challenge your ability to integrate AI agents with a robust backend search system.

**Minimum Requirements:**
1. Maintain a Git repository for your project.
2. Include a `requirements.txt` file documenting all dependencies and package versions.
3. If creating a software package, use Poetry or a similar tool to make it installable.
4. If building a web-based app, ensure it includes a front-end and a back-end.
5. If the project is associated with a company or startup, adhere to their specific rules and guidelines.

### Option X: Your Own Idea

Propose a unique project idea that aligns with the course objectives. Your proposal must include a detailed description of the project, a clear roadmap, and the intended deliverables. Approval from the instructor is required to proceed.

**Minimum Requirements (for all projects):**
1. Maintain a Git repository for your project.
2. Include a `requirements.txt` file documenting all dependencies and package versions.
3. If creating a software package, use Poetry or a similar tool to make it installable.
4. If building a web-based app, ensure it includes a front-end and a back-end.
5. If the project is associated with a company or startup, adhere to their specific rules and guidelines.
