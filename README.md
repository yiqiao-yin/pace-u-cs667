## Introduction

Welcome to CS667 - Practical Data Science! This project-based course is designed to guide you through the full lifecycle of a data science project, from ideation to production. You will learn how to formulate a problem, collect and preprocess data, build and validate models, and deploy your solutions into real-world environments. By the end of the course, you will have practical experience in handling data science challenges and delivering deployable solutions.

## Projects

We are excited to dive into Project 1 and Project 2 together during our class discussions. These projects are essential for passing the class and will help you understand the fundamentals.

However, upon approval, you may choose to work on one of the Projects 3, 4, or 5 with external stakeholders instead of Project 1 and Project 2. These projects come with the unique opportunity to collaborate with industry professionals and could potentially lead to full-time job offers. We will provide you with various tools to help you assess the complexity and industry relevance of these technical projects.

Take advantage of these opportunities to connect with real-world experiences and boost your career prospects!

Please see the detailed projects on this [page](./capstone/README.md)

## Grading

This course is graded on a Pass/Fail basis. To pass, you must successfully complete a complete data science, machine learning, or AI project, demonstrating your understanding of the data science lifecycle and your ability to produce functional, real-world-ready solutions.

We will be using [this link](https://airtable.com/embed/appBjNPgdot15ZqO7/pagKL7hfbTouEflS9/form) for all of the submissions.

You will pass this class if both of the following criteria have been met:
- Fill up the submission form after every single class as participation. You can be excused for 2 classes for medical reasons.
- Upon approval of the completion of the project. For details of capstone project, please see [here](./capstone/README.md)
