## Introduction

Welcome to CS667 - Practical Data Science! This project-based course is designed to guide you through the full lifecycle of a data science project, from ideation to production. You will learn how to formulate a problem, collect and preprocess data, build and validate models, and deploy your solutions into real-world environments. By the end of the course, you will have practical experience in handling data science challenges and delivering deployable solutions.

## Projects

We are excited to dive into Project 1 and Project 2 together during our class discussions. These projects are essential for passing the class and will help you understand the fundamentals. Required projects can be seen [here](./capstone/README.md). Each project has 3 deadlines. You must submit at least 2 out of 3 deadlines.

Additionally, you must choose and attempt at least 1 projects with external stakeholders on top of Project 1 and Project 2. Since submissions are already made, the list will be hidden. But feel free to reach out if you want to see the detailed list. These projects come with the unique opportunity to collaborate with industry professionals and could potentially lead to full-time job offers. We will provide you with various tools to help you assess the complexity and industry relevance of these technical projects.

Take advantage of these opportunities to connect with real-world experiences and boost your career prospects!

Please see the detailed projects on this [page](./capstone/README.md)

## Grading

This course is graded on a Pass/Fail basis. To pass, you must successfully complete a complete data science, machine learning, or AI project, demonstrating your understanding of the data science lifecycle and your ability to produce functional, real-world-ready solutions.

### Submissions
We will be using [this link](https://airtable.com/embed/appBjNPgdot15ZqO7/pagKL7hfbTouEflS9/form) for all of the submissions. All submissions will be using the same link listed in this section. Please take this part seriously as you may fail the class if you do not have enough the submissions.

You will **pass** this 3-credit class if both of the following criteria have been met:
- Fill up the submission form after every single class as participation. You can be excused for 2 classes for medical reasons. During the semester, we will be covering project 1 and project 2, which are discussed [here](./capstone/README.md). Project 1 and Project 2 each have 3 submissions. You must fulfill at least 2/3 of these submissions.
- Additionally, you are also required to work at least one of the following projects. Please see this [list](./capstone/extra_proj.md). These ideas are based on realworld applications in a variety of industry and it is highly recommended to take these projects seriously!
